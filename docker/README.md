## How to build the Docker image

### 1. Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile

#### 1.1. Build using a local Transfer CFT package

1) Download the Transfer CFT product package from [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/).

The Dockerfile is compatible with Transfer CFT 3.6-SP1 version and higher.

From the [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/), download the latest package for linux-x86-64.

2) Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile.

From the folder where the Dockerfile is located, using the downloaded package as a build argument, run the command:
```console
docker build --build-arg INSTALL_KIT=Transfer_CFT_3.10.2203_Install_b9dcb51484_linux-x86-64.zip -t cft/cft:3.10.2203 .
```

#### 1.2. Build using a Transfer CFT package stored on your own HTTP server

1) Download the Transfer CFT product package from [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/).

The Dockerfile is compatible with Transfer CFT 3.6-SP1 version and higher.

From the [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/), download the latest package for linux-x86-64 and make it available in your network.

2) Build the Docker image from your Dockerfile.

From the folder where the Dockerfile is located, run the command:

```console
docker build --build-arg URL_BASE=https://network.package.location/ -t cft/cft:3.10.2203 .
```
*Note* You can customize the VERSION_BASE, RELEASE_BASE arguments from the Dockerfile to build a Docker image based on a different Transfer CFT version/level.

### 2. Check that the Docker image is successfully created

Run the command:

```console
docker images --filter reference=cft/cft
```

You should get an output like:
```console

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
