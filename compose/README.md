# Axway Transfer CFT Docker Compose

Transfer CFT Docker image

## Before you begin

This document assumes a basic understanding of core Docker concepts such as containers, container images, and basic Docker commands.
If needed, see [Get started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) for a primer on container basics or [Docker Compose Overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for details on using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 23.0 or higher
- Docker Compose v2 or higher

## How to use the Transfer CFT compose YAML files

The file [`compose.yml`](./compose.yml) describes and allows you to manage the Transfer CFT service.
The file [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) describes the Transfer CFT service in a multinode environment, and allows the management of a scalable Transfer CFT service.

You can build your own Transfer CFT image using [`docker/Dockerfile`](../docker/Dockerfile) or use the official Axway Transfer CFT Docker image.

### compose parameters

The following parameters can be set in compose YAML files. Use these parameters to customize the Transfer CFT image and service. All values are transmitted to Transfer CFT using environment variables.

In this README, Central Governance can represent either Central Governance or Flow Manager.

### How to use the official Transfer CFT Docker image

1) Log in to the Axway Docker registry.

You only need to perform this step for the initial login. If you do not have your Axway service account credentials, you can follow the instructions in [Axway Documentation](https://docs.axway.com/search?q=Installing+Transfer+CFT+in+a+container) to obtain them.

```console
docker login docker.repository.axway.com --username <service_account_client_id>
```

Enter as password, your service_account_client_secret.

2) Log in to [Axway Repository](https://repository.axway.com/).

Use same credentials used for [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/)

3) Find Transfer CFT official docker image in the catalog.

Search for "Transfer CFT DockerImage" and select the appropriate version.

4) Pull Transfer CFT docker image:

```console
docker pull docker.repository.axway.com/transfercft-docker-prod/3.10/cft:3.10.2206
```

**Note:** Docker tag can be used to rename/retag the official docker image, for example:

```console
docker tag docker.repository.axway.com/transfercft-docker-prod/3.10/cft:3.10.2206 axway/cft:3.10.2206
```


### How to manage the Transfer CFT service from your compose YAML file

You can use Docker Compose to automate building container images, as well as application deployment and customization.

#### 1. Customization

Before you start, customize the parameters in the [`compose.yml`](./compose.yml) file.

Set the image parameter to match the image you want to use. For example: "image: axway/cft:3.10.2206".

If you want your Transfer CFT to be fully functional, you should change the CFT_FQDN parameter to reflect the host machine's name in the network (IP address can also be used).  
**Note:** You cannot connect to some Transfer CFT interfaces if this parameter is not properly set.

To register Transfer CFT with Central Governance, set CFT_CG_ENABLE to "YES", and configure the CFT_CG_HOST, CFT_CG_PORT, and CFT_CG_SHARED_SECRET parameters.

Customizing other parameters is optional.

#### 2. Transfer CFT license key

You require a linux-x86-64 platform key that does not have a specified hostname. Enter this Transfer CFT license key in the `conf/license-key` file.

#### 3. Data persistence

The Transfer CFT [`compose.yml`](./compose.yml) file defines a volume as a mechanism for persisting data generated and used by Transfer CFT.
The Transfer CFT runtime is placed in this volume so it can be reused when creating and starting a new Transfer CFT container. See the Upgrade section for details.

You can change the volume configuration to use a previously created volume, as described in [Volumes top-level elements](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/07-volumes) and [Create and manage volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#create-and-manage-volumes).

#### 4. Create and start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the compose YAML file is located, run the command:

```console
docker compose up
```

The `up` command builds (if needed), recreates, starts, and attaches to a container for services.
Unless they are already running, this command also starts any linked services.

You can use the -d option to run containers in the background.

```console
docker compose up -d
```

To create an anonymous volume, instead of retrieving data from previous containers, use the  -V option. Doing so forcefully creates a runtime. It could be useful for debugging purpose.

```console
docker compose up -V
```

Run the `docker ps` or `docker container ls` command to see the running containers.


#### 5. Stop and remove the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose.yml`](./compose.yml) file is located, you can stop the containers using the command:

```console
docker compose down
```

The `down` command stops containers, and removes containers, networks, anonymous volumes, and images created by `up`.
You can use the `-v` option to remove named volumes declared in the `volumes` section of the Compose YAML file, and anonymous volumes attached to containers.

#### 6. Start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose.yml`](./compose.yml) file is located, you can start the Transfer CFT service using `start` if it was stopped using `stop`.

```console
docker compose start
```

#### 7. Stop the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose.yml`](compose.yml) file is located, you can stop the containers using the command:

```console
docker compose stop
```

#### 8. Access Transfer CFT directories in the container
For debugging purpose, you can require access to the Transfer CFT container.

List the running containers using the command:

```console
docker container ls
```
Locate the container ID, for example 0cdg611581c9.
Using the container ID, run the following command:

```console
docker exec -it 0cdg611581c9 /bin/bash
```
From within the container you can then run Transfer CFT commands:

```console
axway@demo:~$ pwd
/opt/axway
axway@demo:~$ cd data/runtime/
axway@demo:~/data/runtime$ . ./profile

axway@demo:~/data/runtime$ CFTUTIL ...
```

#### 9. Upgrade Transfer CFT

You can use the upgrade option to change the image used for Transfer CFT without losing Transfer CFT's data (i.e. keep the runtime). This could be useful, for example, if you want to work with a newly released update instead of the current one, or you want to add some security options to the Linux kernel, for example.

You must first load the new Transfer CFT image in your repository. You can either:
- Use an official Transfer CFT image, as described in the section [How to use the official Transfer CFT Docker image](#how-to-use-the-official-transfer-cft-docker-image)
- Build a new Transfer CFT image, using the instructions in [`docker/README.md`](../docker/README.md)

##### 1. Export the Transfer CFT data (not necessary for patches)

This step is only mandatory if you upgrade to a new update, such as moving from version 3.10.2206 to version 3.10.2209. This step is not required when applying a patch, for example, from 3.10.2209 to 3.10.2209 P1. Invoke the REST API cft/container/export. user:password refers to the credentials that you use to connect to the UI or the REST API.

```console
curl -k -u user:password -X PUT "https://${CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/api/v1/cft/container/export" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Check that the REST API call returns 200.

##### 2. Update the image parameter

Set the image parameter to match the image you want to use. For example: "image: axway/cft:3.10.2206".

##### 3. Stop and remove the container

To stop and remove the container, run the command:

```console
docker compose down
```

##### 4. Recreate and start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the compose.yml is located, run the command:

```console
docker compose up
```

This command recreates and starts a Transfer CFT container based on the new image. When the container starts, it detects the exported data and imports it during startup.

### Multinode architecture

There are two ways of configuring the Transfer CFT in multinode architecture using compose.

#### Multinode on a Docker cluster

In this use case, all Transfer CFT nodes run in the same Docker cluster and the scale command from compose defines the number of nodes to start.

The file [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) is written for this use case. Using the list [here](#compose-parameters) you can change the parameters as needed.

The information in the topics  [Customization](#1-customization) through [Data persistence](#3-data-persistence) apply here.

**NOTE:** Customization of Nginx configuration file [`nginx.conf`](./nginx.conf) can be necessary to integrate the desired number of nodes.

##### 1. Create and start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, run the command:

```console  
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml up --scale cft=<NUMBER_OF_NODES>
```
Where `NUMBER_OF_NODES` should have the same value as `CFT_MULTINODE_NUMBER` inside the compose YAML file.

The `up` command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to a container for services. And, unless they are already running, this command also starts any linked services.

You can use the -d option to run containers in the background.

```console  
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml up --scale cft=<NUMBER_OF_NODES> -d
```
##### 2. Stop and remove the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the `compose-multinode.yml` file is located, you can stop the containers using the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml down
```

The `down` command stops containers, and removes containers, networks, anonymous volumes, and images created by `up`.  
You can use the -v option to remove named volumes declared in the `volumes` section of the Compose YAML file, and anonymous volumes attached to containers.

##### 3. Start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, you can start the Transfer CFT service using `start` if it was stopped using `stop`.

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml start
```

##### 4. Stop the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, you can stop the containers using the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml stop
```

##### 5. Upgrade Transfer CFT

You can use the upgrade option to change the image used for Transfer CFT without losing Transfer CFT's data (i.e. keep the runtime). This could be useful, for example, if you want to work with a newly released update instead of the current one, or you want to add some security options to the Linux kernel.

You must first load the new Transfer CFT image in your repository. You can either:
- Use an official Transfer CFT image, as described in the section [How to use the official Transfer CFT Docker image](#how-to-use-the-official-transfer-cft-docker-image)
- Build a new Transfer CFT image, using the instructions in [`docker/README.md`](../docker/README.md)

###### 1. Update the image parameter

Set the image parameter to match the image you want to use. For example: "image: axway/cft:3.10.2206".

###### 2. Export the Transfer data (not necessary for patches)

This step is only mandatory if you upgrade to a new update, such as moving from version 3.10.2203 to version 3.10.2206. This step is not required when applying a patch, for example, from 3.10.2203 to 3.10.2203 P1. Invoke the REST API cft/container/export. user:password refers to the credentials that you use to connect to the UI or the REST API.

```console
curl -k -u user:password -X PUT "https://${CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/api/v1/cft/container/export" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Check that the REST API call returns 200.

###### 3. Stop and remove the container

To stop and remove the container, run the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml down
```

###### 4. Recreate and start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) is located, run the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml up --scale cft=<NUMBER OF NODES>
```

This command recreates and starts a Transfer CFT container based on the new image. When the container starts, it detects the exported data and imports it during startup.

**Note:** This command should use the same `NUMBER_OF_NODES` previously used.


#### Multinode on multiple standalone Docker servers

In this set-up, different Docker servers will be used to run each of the Transfer CFT containers.

The file [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) need to be changed to adapt do this case and there are a few prerequisites to make it work.

Prerequisites:

* External load-balancer
* External NFS shared disk

The modifications are:

* NGINX is not used, so the block for service nginx should be removed from file compose-multinode.yml.
* `CFT_LOAD_BALANCER_HOST` and `CFT_LOAD_BALANCER_PORT` should be set to reflect the load balancer information.
* `CFT_FQDN` should be set using the host machine information, which should change for each of the host machines.
* You must add `- "33000-33100"` to the exposed section of file `compose-multinode.yml`.
* Define the Transfer CFT's listening port range, according to the port range set in the previous step. For that, you must set up a custom initialization script using the parameter `USER_SCRIPT_INIT`. The script must contain the following lines:
```console
. ${CFT_CFTDIRRUNTIME}/profile
CFTUTIL uconfset id=cft.multi_node.listen_port_range, value="33000-33100"
```

Then use the list described [here](#compose-parameters) to change the parameters as needed.

The information in the topics [Customization](#1-customization) and [License Key](#2-transfer-cft-license-key) apply here.

##### 1. Data persistence

The Transfer CFT volume should point to an NFS disk. The volumes section of file [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) should look like this:

```console
volumes:
  cft_data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: "nfs4"
      o: "addr=[YOUR_EFS_DNS],nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,cto,nointr,lock,async"
      device: "[YOUR_EFS_DNS]:/"
```

##### 2. Create the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, run the following command on each Docker server:

```console  
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml up
```

The `up` command builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to a container for services. And, unless they are already running, this command also starts any linked services.

You can use the -d option to run containers in the background.

```console  
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml up -d
```
##### 3. Stop and remove the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, you can stop the containers on each Docker server using the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml down
```

The `down` command stops containers and removes containers, networks, anonymous volumes, and images created by `up`.  
You can use the -v option to remove named volumes declared in the `volumes` section of the Compose YAML file, and anonymous volumes attached to containers.

##### 4. Start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, on each Docker server you can start the Transfer CFT service using `start` if it was stopped using `stop`.

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml start
```

##### 5. Stop the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) file is located, you can stop the containers on each Docker server using the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml stop
```

##### 6. Upgrade Transfer CFT

You can use the upgrade option to change the image used for Transfer CFT without losing Transfer CFT's data (i.e. keep the runtime). This could be useful, for example, if you want to work with a newly released update instead of the current one, or you want to add some security options to the Linux kernel, for example.

You must first load the new Transfer CFT image in your repository. You can either:
- Use an official Transfer CFT image, as described in the section [How to use the official Transfer CFT Docker image](#how-to-use-the-official-transfer-cft-docker-image)
- Build a new Transfer CFT image, using the instructions in [`docker/README.md`](../docker/README.md)

###### 1. Update the image parameter

Set the image parameter to match the image you want to use. For example: "image: axway/cft:3.10.2206".

###### 2. Export the Transfer data (not necessary for patches)

This step is only mandatory if you upgrade to a new update, such as moving from version 3.10.2206 to version 3.10.2209. This step is not required when applying a patch, for example, from 3.10.2206 to 3.10.2206 P1. Invoke the REST API cft/container/export. user:password refers to the credentials that you use to connect to the UI or the REST API.

```console
curl -k -u user:password -X PUT "https://${CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/api/v1/cft/container/export" -H "accept: application/json"
```
Check that the REST API call returns 200.

###### 3. Stop and remove the container

To stop and remove the container, run the following command on each Docker server:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml down
```

###### 4. Recreate and start the Transfer CFT service

From the folder where the [`compose-multinode.yml`](./compose-multinode.yml) is located, on each Docker server run the command:

```console
docker compose -f compose-multinode.yml up
```

This command recreates and starts a Transfer CFT container based on the new image. When the container starts, it detects the exported data and imports it during startup.


### Connecting to interfaces

When you start the Transfer CFT container for the first time, if both `USER_XFBADM_LOGIN` and `USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD` are defined, the corresponding user is added to the xfbadmusr database.

When a user is created, the container logs display:
```
Creating user $USER_XFBADM_LOGIN...
User $USER_XFBADM_LOGIN created.
```
Otherwise, the following message displays:
```
WARNING: Password required to create an user. Not creating one!
```

Access the Transfer CFT REST API documentation by connecting to: 

```
https://${CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/api/v1/ui/index.html
```

Access the Transfer CFT UI by connecting to:

```
https://${CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/ui
```

**Note:** When using multinode, use the load balancer address instead of `CFT_FQDN`.

### Customization

This section explains how to customize the default XFBADM user, the Central Governance SSL CA certificate, the Sentinel SSL CA certificate, the Copilot server SSL certificate, and scripts invoked when creating or starting a container.
To enable customization, you must define a mapped volume that refers to a local directory containing the SSL certificates and/or the user's password files.
In this example, the directory `/opt/app/custom` in the container maps the local directory `./custom`. The mapped directory `/opt/app/custom` is in read-only mode.

```
volumes:
  - ./custom:/opt/app/custom:ro
```

#### Default XFBADM user

To create an XFBADM user during the container creation, set variables `USER_XFBADM_LOGIN` and `USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD` as follow:
- `USER_XFBADM_LOGIN`: A string that refers to the login.
- `USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD`: A command that returns the password such as 'cat userpassword.txt', where the file, for example userpassword.txt, contains the password.

For details, see `USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD` in the compose.yml.

#### SSL Certificates

To specify your SSL certificates as a Central Governance CA certificate, a Sentinel CA certificate, and a Copilot server certificate, use the following parameters:
- `USER_CG_CA_CERT`: The path to the Central Governance CA certificate.
- `USER_SENTINEL_CA_CERT`: The path to the Sentinel CA certificate.
- `USER_COPILOT_CERT`: The path to the Copilot server certificate. It must refer to a PKCS12 certificate.
- `USER_COPILOT_CERT_PASSWORD`: A command that returns the Copilot server certificate password. If the password is stored in a file named copilot_p12.pwd, its value is `'cat copilot_p12.pwd'`.

For example:
```
service:
    cft:
        environment:
            USER_CG_CA_CERT:            "/run/secrets/cg_ca_cert.pem"
            USER_SENTINEL_CA_CERT:      "/run/secrets/sentinel_ca_cert.pem"
            USER_COPILOT_CERT:          "/run/secrets/copilot.p12"
            USER_COPILOT_CERT_PASSWORD: "cat /run/secrets/copilot_p12.pwd"
secrets:
    cg_ca_cert.pem:
        file: ./conf/cg_ca_cert.pem
    sentinel_ca_cert.pem:
        file: ./conf/sentinel_ca_cert.pem
    copilot.p12:
       file: ./conf/copilot.p12
    copilot_p12.pwd:
        file: ./conf/copilot_p12.pwd
```

If one of the specified certificates has changed, when the container starts it is automatically updated so that the container always uses the certificate located in the local directory.

#### Custom scripts

The `USER_SCRIPT_INIT` and `USER_SCRIPT_START` parameters let you specify, respectively, a script that executes when the container is created, and another that executes each time the container starts.

For example:

```
service:
    cft:
        environment:
            USER_SCRIPT_INIT:   "/opt/app/custom/init.sh"
            USER_SCRIPT_START:  "/opt/app/custom/startup.sh"
```
