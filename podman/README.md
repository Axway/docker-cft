# Axway Transfer CFT Podman

### Prerequisites

- [podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) version 3.1.0 or higher

## How to use the Transfer CFT podman files

This README refers to managing single-node installations of Transfer CFT using podman.

The podman.yml describes and allows you to configure the Transfer CFT deployment.

The script podman-helper.sh can be used to help managing Transfer CFT.

**Note:** If you change yaml parameter values, adequate values in podman-helper.sh before using the script. 

> **Tip**: There is also a [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose) that can be used with the yaml files present in the ../compose folder.

### How to use the official Transfer CFT Docker image

1) Download the Transfer CFT DockerImage from [Axway Support](https://support.axway.com/).

2) Load the image.

From the folder where the Transfer_CFT_3.10.2203_DockerImage_cc4ac9b642_linux-x86-64.tgz is located, run the command:

```console
podman load -i Transfer_CFT_3.10.2203_DockerImage_cc4ac9b642_linux-x86-64.tgz
```

3) Check that the image is successfully loaded.

Run the command:

```console
podman images --filter reference=cft/cft
```

You should get an output like:
```console
REPOSITORY           TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
localhost/cft/cft    3.10.2203   6103e0dd02c9  7 weeks ago  381 MB
```

### How to manage the Transfer CFT pod from your podman.yml file

You can use `podman play kube` to automate application deployment and customization.

#### 1. Customization

Before you start, customize the parameters in the podman.yml.

Set the image parameter to match the image you want to use. For example: "image: localhost/cft/cft:3.10.2203".

You must accept the applicable General Terms and Conditions to be able to continue. These are located at [https://www.axway.com/en/legal/contract-documents](https://www.axway.com/en/legal/contract-documents).

If you want your Transfer CFT to be fully functional, you should change the CFT_FQDN parameter to reflect the host machineâ€™s name in the network (IP address can also be used).

**Note:** You cannot connect to some Transfer CFT interfaces if this parameter is not properly set.

To register Transfer CFT with Flow Manager or Central Governance, set CFT_CG_ENABLE to "YES", and configure the CFT_CG_HOST, CFT_CG_PORT, and CFT_CG_SHARED_SECRET parameters.

Customizing other parameters is optional.

##### 1.1 podman.yml parameters

The following parameters are available in the podman.yml file. Use these parameters to customize the Transfer CFT container and pod. All values are transmitted to Transfer CFT using environment variables.

In this README, Central Governance can represent either Central Governance or Flow Manager.

#### 2. Transfer CFT license key

Enter your Transfer CFT license key in the conf/cft.key file. You need a license for the linux-x86-64 platform. The hostname defined for the key must match the hostname value set in the podman.yml file. Podman defines hostname based on the key metadata:name in yaml.

**Note**: The default value for hostname in podman.yml is cft-pod, if you do not change this, this is the value you should use for your key.

#### 3. Data persistence

The Transfer CFT podman.yml file makes reference to a volume named cft_data. This volume is created automatically when the container is created using `podman play kube ./podman.yml` or `podman-helper.sh create`

The Transfer CFT runtime is placed in this volume so it can be reused when creating and starting a new Transfer CFT container. See the Upgrade section for details.

#### 4. Create and start the Transfer CFT pod

From the folder where the podman.yml file is located, run the command:

```console
podman play kube ./podman.yml
```

Using the podman-helper.sh, this would be:

```console
podman-helper.sh create
```

To see the running containers, run:

```console
podman pod ps -f name=cft-pod
```

or

```console
podman-helper.sh status
```

#### 5. Stop and remove the Transfer CFT pod

You can stop the containers using the command:

```console
podman pod stop cft-pod
```

or, from the folder where the podman.yml file is located, run the command:

```console
podman-helper.sh stop
```

To remove the pod, run the command:

```console
podman pod rm -f cft-pod
```

or, from the folder where the podman.yml file is located, run the command:

```console
podman-helper.sh delete
```

To remove the volume while deleting the pod, run the command:

```console
podman-helper.sh purge
```

#### 6. Start the Transfer CFT pod

You can start the containers using the command:

```console
podman pod start cft-pod
```

or, from the folder where the podman.yml file is located, run the command:

```console
podman-helper.sh start
```

#### 7. Access Transfer CFT directories in the container

For debugging purpose, you can require access to the Transfer CFT container.

Using the container name, run the following command:

```console
podman exec -it cft-pod-cft /bin/bash
```

From within the container you can then run Transfer CFT commands:

```console
axway@cft-pod:~$ pwd
/opt/axway
axway@cft-pod:~$ cd data/runtime/
axway@cft-pod:~/data/runtime$ . ./profile
axway@cft-pod:~/data/runtime$ CFTUTIL ...
```

#### 8. Upgrade Transfer CFT

You can use the upgrade option to change the image used for Transfer CFT without losing Transfer CFT's data (i.e. keep the runtime). This could be useful, for example, if you want to work with a newly released 3.10.2206 instead of the current 3.10.2203, or you want to add some security options to the Linux kernel.

You must first load the new Transfer CFT image in your repository. You can either:
- Use an official Transfer CFT image, as described in the section "How to use the official Transfer CFT Docker image"
- Build a new Transfer CFT image, using the instructions in ../docker/README.md

##### 1. Export Transfer CFT data

This step is currently mandatory.

```console
curl -k -u user:password -X PUT "https://${CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/api/v1/cft/container/export" -H "accept: application/json"
```
where user:password refers to the credentials that you use to connect to the UI or the REST API.

Check that the REST API call returns 200.

##### 2. Update the image parameter

Set the image parameter to match the image you want to use. For example: "image: localhost/cft/cft:3.10.2206".

##### 3. Stop, remove, recreate and start the pod

To stop and remove the container, run the commands:

```console
podman pod stop cft-pod
podman pod rm -f cft-pod
```

To recreate and start the pod, from the folder where the podman.yml file is located, run the command:

```console
podman play kube ./podman.yml
```

These can also be run using the helper:

```console
podman-helper.sh update
```

### Connecting to interfaces

When you start the Transfer CFT container for the first time, if both USER_XFBADM_LOGIN and USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD are defined, the corresponding user is added to the xfbadmusr database.

When a user is created, the container logs display:
```
Creating user $USER_XFBADM_LOGIN...
User $USER_XFBADM_LOGIN created.
```
Otherwise, the following message displays:
```
WARNING: Password required to create an user. Not creating one!
```

Access the Transfer CFT REST API documentation by connecting to:

```
https://S{CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/api/v1/ui/index.html
```

Access the Transfer CFT UI by connecting to:

```
https://S{CFT_FQDN}:1768/cft/ui
```

### Customization

This section explains how to customize the default XFBADM user, the Central Governance SSL CA certificate, the Sentinel SSL CA certificate, the Copilot server SSL certificate, and scripts invoked when creating or starting a container.
To enable customization, you must define a mapped volume that refers to a local directory containing the SSL certificates and/or the user's password files.
For each of the parameters listed in this section, uncoment the corresponding lines in the env, volumes and volumeMounts sections of the podman.yml file.

#### Default XFBADM user

To create an XFBADM user during the container creation, set variables USER_XFBADM_LOGIN and USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD as follow:
- USER_XFBADM_LOGIN: A string that refers to the login.
- USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD: A file that contains the password.

For details, see USER_XFBADM_PASSWORD in the podman.yml.

#### SSL Certificates

To specify your SSL certificates as a Central Governance CA certificate, a Sentinel CA certificate, and a Copilot server certificate, use the following parameters:
- USER_CG_CA_CERT: The path to the Central Governance CA certificate.
- USER_SENTINEL_CA_CERT: The path to the Sentinel CA certificate.
- USER_COPILOT_CERT: The path to the Copilot server certificate. It must refer to a PKCS12 certificate.
- USER_COPILOT_CERT_PASSWORD: A file that contains the Copilot server certificate password.

For example:
```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cft
      env:
        - name: USER_CG_CA_CERT
          value: "/run/secrets/cg_ca_cert.pem"
        - name: USER_SENTINEL_CA_CERT
          value: "/run/secrets/sentinel_ca_cert.pem"
        - name: USER_COPILOT_CERT
          value: "/run/secrets/copilot.p12"
        - name: USER_COPILOT_CERT_PASSWORD
          value: "/run/secrets/copilot_p12.pwd"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: cg_ca_cert.pem
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: /run/secrets/cg_ca_cert.pem
        - name: sentinel_ca_cert.pem
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: /run/secrets/sentinel_ca_cert.pem
        - name: copilot.p12
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: /run/secrets/copilot.p12
        - name: copilot_p12.pwd
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: /run/secrets/copilot_p12.pwd
  volumes:
    - name: cg_ca_cert.pem
      hostPath:
        path: ./conf/cg_ca_cert.pem
        type: File
    - name: sentinel_ca_cert.pem
      hostPath:
        path: ./conf/sentinel_ca_cert.pem
        type: File
    - name: copilot.p12
      hostPath:
        path: ./conf/copilot.p12
        type: File
    - name: copilot_p12.pwd
      hostPath:
        path: ./conf/copilot_p12.pwd
        type: File
```

If one of the specified certificates has changed, when the container starts it is automatically updated so that the container always uses last certificate mapped in the container from the host directory.

#### Custom scripts

The USER_SCRIPT_INIT and USER_SCRIPT_START parameters let you specify, respectively, a script that executes when the container is created, and another that executes each time the container starts.

For example:

```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: cft
      env:
        - name: USER_SCRIPT_INIT
          value: "/opt/app/custom/init.sh"
        - name: USER_SCRIPT_START
          value: "/opt/app/custom/startup.sh"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: custom
          mountPath: /opt/app/custom/
  volumes:
    - name: custom
      hostPath:
        path: ./custom
        type: Directory
```
